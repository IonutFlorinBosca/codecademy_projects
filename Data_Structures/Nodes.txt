 Nodes

 Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of many computer science
 data structures. They form the basis for linked lists, stacks, queues,
 trees, etc.

 An individual node contains data and links to other nodes. Typically,
 data structures implement nodes with one or more links. If these links
 are null, it denotes that you have reached the end of the particular 
 node or link path that you were previously following!

 If you accidentally remove the single link to a node, that node's data
 and any linked nodes could be 'lost' to the application and the node 
 becomes an orphaned node!
