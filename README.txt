Hello there! I am Ionut and here is where I started documenting my path of becoming a software engineer!

I started with a codecademy online bootcamp that gave me the basics on:
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - JavaScript 
 - React
 - Github
 
 So far most of the commits I made are from challenges within the online bootcamp. 
 There are 2 projects though that I made on my own; 2 react webapps.
